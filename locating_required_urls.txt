In some situations, a branch or archive might not contain all required files
and will reference other locations for its dependencies.

Usually this would be covered by listing some URLs, but the Internet is a
rapidly changing environment.

New TLDs come, old ones being phased out, Internet providers go bankrupt,
merge or are being taken over, often enough leading to the change of server
names in URLs.

Trademark issues are another reason why server names - and thus URLs - change
over time in many situations, and are therefore not useful as long-lasting
references where to find anything.

I therefore avoid using URLs when referencing branches or download locations,
but rather refer to unique file- or directory names to be found by a search
engine.

For that reason, all my Bazaar branches have a UUID as the last part of the
name - such as in

trunk-jv3gwuidf2ezyr5vbqavqtxyh

The part before the last dash in the name is the human-readable branch name,
and it does not need to be unique. It is just a general hint what the branch
contains. It might change in the future, although it usually won't.

The really important part is only the 25-character BASE-35 encoded DCE UUID at
the end of the directory name.

The best way to find such a resource is therefore using an arbitrary Internet
search engine.

If the search engine allows wildcards for suffix searches, it might be best to
search for the above branch using a glob pattern like

*-jv3gwuidf2ezyr5vbqavqtxyh

or a Regexp like

-jv3gwuidf2ezyr5vbqavqtxyh$

or

.*-jv3gwuidf2ezyr5vbqavqtxyh

depending on the anchor matching behavior used by the Regex implementation.

For locating web pages rather than branch directories, a common suffix like
.html might have to be added after the UUID.

In any case, the advantage of the approach is that changing DNS names do not
matter, and even reorganizing the directory structure within the server won't
render the content unlocatable.
