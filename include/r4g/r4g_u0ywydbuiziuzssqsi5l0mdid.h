 * that will probably never happen. The error display routine might report
 * such errors as "generic", "internal", "unspecified", "anonymous" or

 * messages have already been set and should not be touched. In any case,

 * implementation detail of this function. If an error display routine
 * supports dynamic messages, which is optional, it shall display the dynamic
 * message (unless it is empty/unset) instead of the static message. However,
 * an error display routine might also ignore both kinds of error messages and
 * just display the number of errors which occurred. Or even simpler, it might
 * just report that "an error" has occurred without giving any additional
 * details. It is therfore unwise to only set a dynamic message, because an
 * error display routine might choose to ignore the dynamic message and never
 * display it. Then release_c1() will be called to release all resources,
 * which will also display the error message if an appropriate resource
 * destructor for this purpose has been allocated in the resource list before.
