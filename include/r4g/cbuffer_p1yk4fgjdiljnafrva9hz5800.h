/* Expand a simple format string containing string insertion sequences and
 * append it to the current contents of a dynamically allocated string.
 *
 * The variable arguments consist of one or more (int key, const char
 * *expansion)-pairs.
 *
 * Insertion sequences come first in arbitrary order and define a "char" key
 * and an expansion string associated with that key. It the same key occurs
 * multiple times, only the last such argument-pair will be found when
 * referenced from within the format string. Argument-pairs which are never
 * referenced from within the format string are allowed and will have no
 * effect.
 *
 * A key of 0 is special and its associated expansion string then actually
 * represents the format string. The format string is usually also the last
 * argument, because any additional arguments will be ignored.
 *
 * Within the format string, all characters are copied literally to the output
 * buffer except sequences of the form "%" followed by some character. This
 * represents an insertion sequence, and the character following the "%" will
 * be used as a lookup key for finding the expansion string to insert.
 *
 * All possible "char" values (including '%') are valid as keys, not just
 * printable characters. However, a NUL value will not work as key, because
 * then the argument-pair defining its expansion value would be
 * mis-interpreted as the format string.
 *
 * There is no built-in way to output a literal "%". If required it is
 * recommended to include an argument-pair '%', "%" which will copy "%" into
 * the result buffer whenever "%%" occurs within the format string.
 *
 * Argument-pairs referenced by "%"-sequences will be located using a linear
 * search backwards through the pairs starting immediately before the format
 * string. Even though the referenced pairs will be found in any case, for
 * maximum performance more frequently referenced pairs should be placed after
 * less frequently referenced pairs. If all pairs are only referenced exactly
 * once, the order does not affect performance.
 *
 * The resulting augmented string will not have been null-terminated yet. */
